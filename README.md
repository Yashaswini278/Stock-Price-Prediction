# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Modelling
The objective of this project was to predict stock prices using time series modelling. <br/> 
I used Kaggle big5stocks data to predict APPL closing stock price. <br/> 
The data is available here: <br/> 
I experimented with statistical and deep learning based time series models and compared their accuracies. <br/> 
The deep learning based time series model gave more accurate results.
