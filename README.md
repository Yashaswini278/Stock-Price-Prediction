# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Modelling
The objective of this project was to predict stock prices using time series modelling. <br/> 
I used Kaggle big5stocks data to predict APPL closing stock price. <br/> 
The data is available here: <br/> 
I experimented with statistical and deep learning based time series models and compared their accuracies. <br/> 
The deep learning based time series model gave more accurate results.

## Statistical Modelling: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Time Series Modelling
### Key Learnings
1. Learnt the concepts underlying ARIMA(p,d,q) models and the significance and estimation method of the values of p,d and q. <br/>
2. Interpreted the results of the model using accuracy measures, MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE. <br/> 
3. Understood the limitations of ARIMA models: assumptions of linearity and Gaussian noise, challenges in dealing with outliers and long term memory
4.
